### Task Details ℹ️

- Create a “Guess the Number” game on Python.
- When the game starts, it will prompt the user to enter the name of the player and the range (both upper and lower limit) of the number within which the user will have to guess.
- Following this, the game will generate a random number under the range and prompt the user to insert their guess.
- Now, the guess is checked with the original number and the user will be informed if their guess was “Too High” or “Too Low”.
- The users will be appointed 100 points at the start of the Game.
- If they get the guess wrong, a total of 5 points will be deducted from the user's Total Points.
- These points need to be tracked till the end of the number of rounds that the user entered when the game started and will be shown to the user during and at the end of the game.
- The game ends if the user gets the correct guess for the number or if they run out of points.
