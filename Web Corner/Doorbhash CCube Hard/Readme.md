### Challenge Description

When Ravan abducted Mata Sita, Lord Ram dispatched Hanuman, Sugreeva, and Jamwant to search for her in different directions. All the three teams were given the same task. They had to find Mata Sita and inform Lord Ram about her whereabouts.

They faced a communication challenge. They couldn't easily exchange information or coordinate their efforts. To address this, create a chatting website. This website should enable real-time messaging, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration. It should allow them to share updates, discuss strategies, and stay connected despite their physical separation. With the chatting website, they should be able to maximize their collective potential and achieve their goal of finding Mata Sita.
