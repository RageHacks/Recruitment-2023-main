# Translator for Shri Ram

Shri Ram during his studies in Gurukul, learned many Vedas and ancient books. He was taught slokas written by Rishis and Munis from around the country. Therefore he had to face problems converting texts from various languages to his language.

Here is a simple web app to help Shri Ram convert regional texts to his know language. But the app needs some improvement and bug fixes. Complete the TODOs given and make the web app functional. For reference please see the video attached.
