# Task - 04: Towards Ashok Vatika

### Challenge Description

Ram sends Hanuman with his ring to deliver a message to Sita.<br />
However, Hanuman doesn't know Sita's exact location.<br />
Fortunately, Hanuman receives coordinates to Ashok Vatika, but they are encrypted.<br />
Hanuman knows the encryption type, which is a One-Time Pad encryption with the key `Jai Shree Ram!`.<br />
Write a Python code to decrypt the coordinates so that Hanuman can locate Sita and deliver Shree Ram's message.

##### To do -
- Write commented code that decrypts the following text:
```
|OP`Z<E]|Y\$
```
- Store the coordinates in a text file and submit it.
- Search the coordinates on Google Maps and take a screenshot of the location. Submit the screenshot as well.
- The key is:
```
Jai Shree Ram!
```

##### Resources -
- The encryption used is the One-Time Pad (OTP), a basic encryption method in cryptography. It involves performing an XOR operation between the key and the text to be encrypted.
