# Task - 03: `mov stone, ocean`

### Challenge Description

Ram asks Nal to construct a bridge, and Nal has the knowledge of the distance from India to Sri Lanka.<br />
Nal wants to calculate the number of stones required based on the distance from India to Sri Lanka.<br />
However, Nal lacks a proper compiler for high-level languages, so he needs your help to write x86 assembly language code to find the total number of stones.<br />
If it takes 120 stones to build a one-kilometer bridge, how many stones will be needed for a 48-kilometer bridge?<br />
(Note: Assembly language is essential for those interested in reverse engineering or pwnage, so take it seriously.)<br />

##### Resources -
- You can use this compiler to experiment with assembly language: [click here](https://godbolt.org/)
- For further understanding, refer to these resources: [Website 1](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html), [Website 2](https://pwn.college/)

##### Instructions -
- Write the code in NASM syntax and x86 architecture. (You can follow [this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax))
- Use the AX register to store values since it's commonly used for arithmetic operations.
