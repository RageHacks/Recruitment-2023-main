Nearest Vi6ÆŽa,Q still remember the day when you selflessly followed me into the forest, leaving behind the comforts of the palace.Ehen fate tested our love and separated us, my heart shattered into a thousand pieces. Yhe pain of being away from you, my life's companion, was unbearable.Qn every moment of solitude, my thoughts have been consumed by your well/being. Q promise you, my beloved, that Q will not rest until Q have fulfilled my duty and restored you to your rightful place by my side.Xntil the day we are reunited, may the gods watch over you, and may you find solace in the knowledge that my love for you knows no bounds. Pold on to the memories of our love, for they will sustain us through the trials that lie ahead.Eith all the love in my heart,Gour Wam
