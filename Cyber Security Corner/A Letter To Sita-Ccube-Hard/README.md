# A letter to Sita

### Challenge Description

Ram wants to send a letter to Sita through Hanuman. However, he wants to ensure that only Sita can read the letter. To achieve this, Ram asks Neel to create a program that encodes the message.<br />
But he also wants Sita to be able to decode the message.<br />
Unfortunately, Neel, the programmer tasked with creating the encoding program, forgets to inform Hanuman how to decode the message.<br />
Consequently, Hanuman delivers the encoded message to Sita., but how can Sita read the message without decoding it?<br />
Can you help Sita decode the message?<br />

##### Instructions -
- The encoded message by Neel is stored in the file `message.txt`.
- The encryption code written by Neel is provided in the file named `Task - 01.py`.
- You need to retrieve the entire letter message, which is written on a single line, and format it according to the standard letter format.
- It would be convenient to read Python's ord() and char() functions.
